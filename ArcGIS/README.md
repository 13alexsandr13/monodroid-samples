##ArcGIS

[Website](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/android/)

Put the 'WHERE' into your existing native applications or build native Android applications from scratch. Whether your apps are connected to the Internet or completely disconnected, they can perform high-quality and interactive mapping, advanced geo analysis, data editing, queries, geocoding, routing, and a lot more.

####To Build

Download the ArcGIS Android SDK from the download button on this [page](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/android/install.html) and extract the contents into a directory called arcgis-android-sdk at this location.  The PlaceSearch solution (samples/PlaceSearch/PlaceSearch.sln) contains both the project for binding and a sample applicaiton.  You may need to update the EmbeddedReferenceJar entry in the binding project to point to the locaiton of your Android install.
